# Project-Unsupervised-Learning-Apps
* Business Problem: 
  * Our goal is to help guide developers on what apps to create. We will perform textual analysis on Google Play Store apps to identify the most liked apps. The statistics results, such as the number of installed and ratings, provide institutions on which apps are promising to perform well in the Android market will be combined with textual analysis to provide a full scope understanding of app performance. This will enable us to provide to developers the results they can expect (if they have chosen an app to make) or match developers with an app type based on the developersâ€™ goals.  
* Approaches: clustering, sentiment analysis
